# AdventureScript documentation

Current progress:
- [Commands](commands.md) are fully up to date, according to v2.0.0-alpha.3
- [Getting started](start.md) requires a lot of progress, but until the CLI tool is made it's gonna be outdated
- [Config file spec](cfgfile.md) requires progress, what is each thing?? I gotta make it clear.
